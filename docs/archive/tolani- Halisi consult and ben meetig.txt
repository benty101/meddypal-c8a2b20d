Or whatnot. But then interestingly we have. This was actually meant. This was just. This was a commercial idea on its own. Right. But then we then now have a partnership with NABDA to use this like as an. On. As a, as a patient facing onboarding ram for genomic projects that they are doing. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
00:21
Right, interesting. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
00:22
So if you go to the front page, if you go to the home page. Sorry, go back to the homepage if you can. Yeah, if you scroll down a bit. Scroll down a bit. Yeah, here. So the idea is in the. Oh dear. Who is this? The idea is that in the. When the user signs or and have on page as logs into their dashboard. The instead of. Because, you know, typically most of these genomic research or whatever are always done as research. So where you have to sort of enroll people into it. Right. And most times it's a bit difficult getting that consent when you tell somebody, oh, I want to use your data for research or blah, blah. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
01:11
So this is a way to sort of create value to the end users while seeking consent to onboard them into the genomic database. 
T
Tolani Thomas
01:18
Really. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
01:19
So that's is something that we're still trying to really fine tune this and that's the key reason why we're trying to see if we can find funding for different components of it. Be it. The. Be it to find grants to allow people test genomics free of charge. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
01:42
On the platform, then how would it be free? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
01:46
Free for the users. But then it's research grants, stuffs like that. Or if you could find. So whatever ways we used to commercialize this. That's just for that genomic part though. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
01:59
But generally, you know what's crazy, I. 
T
Tolani Thomas
02:01
Think this is what. 54G raised $80 million for. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
02:07
Yeah, exactly. Actually. Yeah, exactly. 
T
Tolani Thomas
02:12
Right. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
02:13
It's something similar. 
T
Tolani Thomas
02:16
Yeah. But they didn't, they didn't. They didn't do it. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
02:19
They sort of did it. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
02:21
They did it. 
T
Tolani Thomas
02:22
But I, I'm familiar with the story. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
02:25
Okay, exactly. Tell me what happened. Please tell me what happened from your perspective. 
T
Tolani Thomas
02:31
They, they raised the money and the money was released. They had so many investors, everything was going well. They were on track. They were doing this like they were like recording like different genomes. They had a lot of people's data and then covet struck and they started, they realized like there's arbitrage with the COVID testing. But they set up, they essentially like pivoted overnight and set up for Kobe testing and then that dried up and. Also fund mismanagement. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
03:02
Okay. 
T
Tolani Thomas
03:04
CEO started insisting on flying privates instead of. Had a massive wedding. He was paying 100 bills at his wedding. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
03:14
I see. 
T
Tolani Thomas
03:15
Yeah. So. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
03:17
Okay, okay. 
T
Tolani Thomas
03:19
And then, I don't know, they shut down. But he kept the data. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
03:23
I know he's still in court, so I'll tell you what, between you and me, right, so we're trying to bring him into this partnership because obviously he has genomic expertise and all that and because obviously the government project. But then you've given me a very clear picture as to what happened commercially in that. Right. I know he's talking cause he's trying to use this as an avenue to see if he can wiggle his way out of the court and get access to that data. But I knew it wasn't going to be far fetched. 
T
Tolani Thomas
03:48
He's really data currently. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
03:50
Yeah, that's what he claimed. But I'm not so sure about that. 
T
Tolani Thomas
03:54
I knew someone internal. I was, I was, I shouldn't be saying this because it's ND is important, but I was previous to one of their meetings. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
04:02
Okay, that's fine. 
T
Tolani Thomas
04:03
Someone on their team was having a meeting with the investors and I listened to what they were saying. They were asking about, you know, where the data is housed, everybody. He just essentially abandoned the whole thing. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
04:14
And I know he resigned at some point. 
T
Tolani Thomas
04:17
Yeah. Yes. But like he just like got tired and walked away and. Yeah, and you know, they say no investors were trying to take over the. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
04:24
Company, but it was, that was impression. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
04:27
I got, that was the story I heard. That was why I felt like the data was being contested. I, I didn't know he had the data. Interesting. 
T
Tolani Thomas
04:34
They were doing the work but then Covid struck and they were like, oh, opportunities to make money. Started doing that. They kind of lost sight. Then you know, a lot of people were laid off as well. It just became a mess. They didn't manage the company well. That, that's like the crux of it. They didn't manage company well and that's. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
04:56
Partly raising bond for Syndicate Bio currently. 
T
Tolani Thomas
05:00
Yeah, I know he immediately said another company that he was not trying to raise for as well. I don't know how far I'd gone because I mean I just stopped paying attention because I was like, this is I cliches. Like it's just boring. So yeah, there's definitely a lot of opportunity for you to risk. I mean obviously you understand that the climate is very difficult right now for you to raise as health tech. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
05:23
Yeah. 
T
Tolani Thomas
05:26
There'S a lot of grant Opportunities that are out there right now, more will probably open up in the new year as well. So would be worth putting your eye out for that. So I think you should do more grants than any other thing. I think that there's obviously these places you can raise for from rather. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
05:51
Okay. 
T
Tolani Thomas
05:54
But I'll be honest with you, a lot of Nigerian versus money has dried up. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
05:58
So everybody's looking for their project like this, right? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
06:00
So I'll tell you what, I, I. First things first. I really appreciate your insight in 54 gene because to me that's always been like. I was trying to understand exactly what happened other than what I read in the news really. Right. Then obviously when I spoke to Dr. Abbasi, I didn't get the clarity. The inclination I got was more or less that there was some form of conflict or friction, right? But then again, I'll tell you what, right? Me personally, I wanted to do this platform without the whole genomics thing involved, right? Just basically being an insurance clearinghouse for both the patient's side and the provider side. So for the patient side, for instance, being able to compare insurance, onboard insurance, have a PHR system and you know, manage your health services in your phone and that kind of stuff. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
06:48
Then on the provider side being able to build multiple HMOs. So for instance, last time I was in Nigeria, I went to take my teeth off. I figured out that they could only bill for two insurances. I asked why, they said that it was some cumbersome challenge, obviously. Say for instance, if they, if they accept 10 HMOs, they need to have a backend for those 10 HMOs. So having some form of an integrated single billing back end or provider side, right? So that enables them obviously provide more care than just feed into the ecosystem. But then this whole government partnership thing came in with this particular government agency that's doing this whole genomic stuff, right? That's how we decided, okay, this is a very good patient facing on RAM for that program. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
07:31
But then again, I now started looking into the whole genomic space is obviously that's a very lucrative angle to this whole stuff. But then I was trying to figure out exactly what happened to the people that have tried it in the past, why they failed and. Really is it worth my while or should I just do what I wanted to do initially commercially, right. In understanding that landscape, a couple of people like you explained. One of the problems I figured with Syndicate was obviously they were running as a highly commercial entity where they Were going basically for VC finance. Obviously profit driven. They are trying to make money. 
T
Tolani Thomas
08:07
Yeah. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
08:07
Obviously the C was life that wasn't helping any of that. And everything went haywire at some point then that's why I figured now. Right then. I don't know if how true the story is about the data being conflicted somehow with some investors. I don't know how true that is. 
T
Tolani Thomas
08:24
I'm not sure about the data being conflicted but I, I, I know that he didn't release data to the investors and that's what the investors wanted. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
08:31
I see. Because I got the impression that he was being bullied by somebody and he needed to get into a government when that's by the by, I forgot what's happening. Anyway, that's fine, that's fine. 
T
Tolani Thomas
08:42
What happened? Because I, I do know someone like I, I know someone that was there to the final day because they couldn't fire her because was that the cto? No, it's cto. She wasn't C level but she was a very integral part of the business in terms of being able to tell investors what was like being able to update investors. And she shouldn't have been because she's not how I say she shouldn't have been in those conversations. But at a point like. You see they essentially the sea level executive actually abandoned the business. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
09:21
Yeah, yeah, that's what I heard. 
T
Tolani Thomas
09:23
Yeah. They essentially just abandoned the business. Like they just got tired. I'm like we are with the data do whatever because things like went missing like physical like data like went missing like overnight and overnight you just set up a new company and let's not focus on him. Let's talk about you. I think you should go if you want to do the genomics thing. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
09:46
Yeah. 
T
Tolani Thomas
09:46
Go to grant routes. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
09:48
Yeah. But then again. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
09:52
Sorry to interrupt. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
09:53
Let me just finish my second thought. So 54 gene was one of the first people have tried doing it in Nigeria. Obviously I think they failed because they went too commercial. Right. But then again there's another president. So that's history Africa that did it somewhere in southern African area. The problem H3Africa they were more of like a government consortium that they, it was more of like please H3 just H3 history consortium or something like that. So the problem I figured with that was that they depended solely on grant money so they were able to, to mobilize a whole lot of grant money for their project. But then again it became more of like a grant Money kind of thing. Once grant money, you know, dried up, nothing else was sustainable. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
10:41
There was no commercial viable sustainability model involved in what they were doing. So what I wanted to achieve here was have a mix of both. 
T
Tolani Thomas
10:47
Right. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
10:47
Or the best of both worlds. I know these genomics things could open up a lot of doors for grants and all that, but then again to also be able to but trace the fact that it's self sustaining on its own outside grant money or whatever. 
T
Tolani Thomas
11:03
I'm not gonna lie to you. I, I, I understand what you're trying to achieve, but I don't really see it because mostly because it has not been done. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
11:12
Okay, right. 
T
Tolani Thomas
11:13
In terms of like. Having a portion of the business that is sort of going to be like pushed by grants and then having a portion of the business that is commercialized. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
11:27
What do you reckon? 
T
Tolani Thomas
11:30
It's a tricky one and it hasn't been, I don't think it's been done before. I can't, I can't think of any reference even the one else that you put down. It's not the same thing you guys are doing. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
11:41
No, no. I didn't even know what any competitors are. 
T
Tolani Thomas
11:44
Just I don't think there's any, like it's a, it's uncharted waters. This is uncharted waters. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
11:49
Yeah, yeah. 
T
Tolani Thomas
11:50
But I, I, I, one of the reasons why I'm not crazy about uncharted waters is like there might be a, a market gap but there's no marketing gap, if you get what I'm saying. Obviously there's opportunity for you to get access to people's like genome data and you know, leverage that to. You know, leverage that for drug testing for different things. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
12:16
Yeah, yeah. 
T
Tolani Thomas
12:16
A lot of use cases. 54G, 54 genes. How I say it reason was valid. It is still valid because very valid does not exist. There's a massive data gap in that regard. Like there's a lot of research that, and I think that there's only one way for that to be done is through grants. There's no patient, there's no capital. I'll be patient enough for you to figure out what you want to do with that genomics thing. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
12:46
Yeah, Yep, yep. 
T
Tolani Thomas
12:48
Yeah. So VC is not presented enough. VC needs to clearly see from day one how you're going to generate 100 million. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
12:56
So what you're saying on the ground route. Sorry, what you're saying basically is going down the ground route. Go down the ground route. Forget about. 
T
Tolani Thomas
13:04
No, I think you should do, I think it should be a Hybrid. Because you want to stay competitive as well. And I think that they would be investors that invest specifically. In this sector. Right. It's an unsexy sector. I'll give it. I'll. I'll tell that. In fact, if you had a female co founder and if you had traction, that means business model has been validated. You're already making some money. I could have introduced you to a VC that would do 200k because there's, there are some VCs that. Well, not a lot but yeah, a few visits. That they're looking for tech startups outside of Fintech. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
13:46
Yeah, I know. 
T
Tolani Thomas
13:47
But they have their terms, you know. Yeah. Is always too much. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
13:50
Yeah. Having a female founder is not an issue. Have a female cto. 
T
Tolani Thomas
13:54
Okay, brilliant. So but you have to have traction. For the genome thing. I think it should be like your okay, this is our R D stuff. It's not our front facing stuff. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
14:11
Exactly. 
T
Tolani Thomas
14:12
So the front facing stuff is. I don't. I'm still trying to wrap my head around this business model of the HMOs because the first thing I thought about is what's your gtm? What's going to be your good market? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
14:26
There's. There's a competitor. I'll give you. Just hang on, let me see if I can find it. Just give me a minute. 
T
Tolani Thomas
14:35
The one. Is it the extra max thing? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
14:38
No, no, no. There's some guys that are doing. So could it Olympia in the chat. 
T
Tolani Thomas
14:45
No worries. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
14:48
So they are doing some. They are providing some form of enterprise solutions for. You know, billing. Billing and business analytics and that kind of stuff. What the hell. Okay. Sorry. 
T
Tolani Thomas
15:04
Is that for healthcare providers to manage? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
15:07
Yes. 
T
Tolani Thomas
15:08
I think I've seen people before. Yeah. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
15:17
You know them? 
T
Tolani Thomas
15:19
No, I don't but it's sort of like a play on. What's that thing called? There's a software that they used to manage. Like healthcare businesses. I forgot what it's called. Used to be the rave one time. Oh. A healthcare management. Yes. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
15:45
Yeah. Something of that nature. 
T
Tolani Thomas
15:46
Yeah. That's actually what it's called. It's an healthcare management system. It's like a play on it, right? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
15:52
Yeah. But to me I think the main issue for me is the fact that what healthcare. Why can't healthcares accept. Accept multiple HMOs? It's too beyond me. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
16:02
They do know they do but like they do. 
T
Tolani Thomas
16:05
But HMOs have rankings. Like there are some HMOs that like you get there. They, they probably won't see or they'll have to call the HMO to confirm. One thing, two things. There are some HMOs that you get into the, you know, healthcare provider waiting area and you don't, you literally don't sit down. They take you directly into. So it really depends. So like HMOs have their rank, I'm sure you know that already. So HMOs, they get a level. Right. So there are some that are premium, some that, you know, they don't on the back end don't, you know, remit to. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
16:41
Yeah. Finding documentation for some. I found it difficult finding documentation for some, while some were a bit more accessible. 
T
Tolani Thomas
16:52
Yeah, I mean it's a lot of opacity in that industry, in healthcare generally. So. Okay, I can see how you're similar to these guys. They have telemedicine as well. Okay, so how do you want to go about the commercial side, not the non genome side of business? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
17:13
Could you elaborate? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
17:14
This, this part is like the, more. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
17:18
Like the provider side of the business, right? 
T
Tolani Thomas
17:21
Yes. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
17:22
So basically to me the, the selling point to the provider would be a unified, you know, management system. Right. That allows you build multiple HMOs, manage your payment system. And so like I take for, I said, for instance, I was so appalled. Like I went into a dentist in Abuja just last month and these guys who are using pen and paper to do record and like I was just so like what's going on? 
T
Tolani Thomas
17:47
It might also be the staff. Sorry, it might also be staff. Like it might be, they might have the software, they might have the tools and the staff don't know how to use. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
18:01
Just doing their thing on their own. 
T
Tolani Thomas
18:03
Yeah. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
18:05
So just stuff like that, simple software solutions to manage their back end customers directly, like you know, booking system and all that kind of stuff. Then obviously to able to manage multiple HMOs. Right. Then the added advantage is there's interoperability with, between that provider side and any patient that presents with the patient facing side where they can push record directly to the patient's health record or health timeline in the patient's dashboard. For instance, if the patient and the provider is using the same system, if that makes sense. 
T
Tolani Thomas
18:43
I'm not seeing it. I'm not getting the business model. So how do you make money? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
18:48
How do I make money? So take for instance when a provider decides to. Put in a claim, for instance, you charge commissions for that, see? And on the patient side, for instance, say they compare insurance and decide to buy insurance, the commissions made for that. 
T
Tolani Thomas
19:07
So you have insurance as well? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
19:10
No, you just Connect them to insurance providers. 
T
Tolani Thomas
19:13
You're a broker. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
19:14
Yes. 
T
Tolani Thomas
19:15
Okay. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
19:19
Then obviously this. 
T
Tolani Thomas
19:20
So would you be onboarding the healthcare providers and the companies or just the healthcare providers? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
19:26
So your question was what? Sorry? 
T
Tolani Thomas
19:29
Would you be onboarding healthcare providers and like companies that need health insurance? Because it's not individuals that health insurance. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
19:38
Yes, of course. You could also like you just explained, you could also have corporates services. 
T
Tolani Thomas
19:43
I think the focus should be corporates because they are the ones that buy. It's like for example, I think five people on my team that are on insurance health insurance plan now. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
19:53
Yeah. 
T
Tolani Thomas
19:54
And. The company. But I'm the one that'll pay for it, right? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
19:59
Yeah, yeah. So that's another angle like you just explained. Those are things to be developed down the line. Right. 
T
Tolani Thomas
20:05
Where I think you should be up front. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
20:08
All right, that's fair enough. 
T
Tolani Thomas
20:10
Yeah. Because that's the. I think that's the nature of. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
20:14
Modus operando for most insurance people. I won't have insurance in Nigeria. Mostly employers are pay but then again right. 
T
Tolani Thomas
20:21
Individuals rare like it happens but really they have to be like a star clients because like they're super informed people. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
20:31
I'll tell you what even got me to this insurance team was when I was trying to find insurance for my mom was really amazed to figure out which insurance get and all that kind of stuff. 
T
Tolani Thomas
20:39
But so how will you rank that like in terms of okay, insurance that is ideal for me that I'm in my 30s versus insurance that I do for someone in their 60 or 70s. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
20:50
How will I rank it on the platform? 
T
Tolani Thomas
20:52
Is there a way to rank it in your back end? Because. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
20:55
Yeah, of course, of course. That's the whole point of it. I'm making it simplified for you. 
T
Tolani Thomas
20:59
Okay. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
21:00
So when you pick a plan, you know what you're covered for, which places you can go to get the coverage you want. And obviously there's now a side to it where providers cannot decide to get ranked on the providers find list and that kind of stuff where you can channel traffic to them as well and that kind of stuff. But then again there's something I find very interesting is that Nigeria passed a law making insurance mandatory for health buildings and those kind of stuff. But I don't think the adoption is. 
T
Tolani Thomas
21:26
Ticking up at all because they're not enforcing it. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
21:29
Oh, I see. 
T
Tolani Thomas
21:30
Yeah. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
21:31
Okay, we'll see though. Well, basically that's the whole idea. 
T
Tolani Thomas
21:38
Yeah, I, I think I, I have. Like a rudimentary knowledge of what you're trying to achieve. So I guess the question is for the stage where you are. I think the business model has to be validated. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
21:52
Yeah, yeah. 
T
Tolani Thomas
21:52
That's obviously get your first 1,000 clients, you know, get a bit of money. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
22:00
I'll tell you what, there are two. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
22:02
Ways we could go about getting our first 1,000 clients. The reason why I stored on it since is because we're trying to work on this partnership with the. Actually we said we started working with Ministry of Science and Technology then obviously stuff happened with something guide and we did not have an MoU with NABDA but initially my intent was to just go straight to a private hospital I have relationships with try and get onboarded like you just said a thousand. A couple thousand people onto the platform then you know, take it to see what. See how things evolve from there. 
T
Tolani Thomas
22:30
Yeah. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
22:31
I stole on order simply because I was thinking that if we get onto this government partnership it is. It will be on that easy way to get like you said the validation. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
22:39
And I kind of stuff like a. 
T
Tolani Thomas
22:41
Tranche of customers in one go. I mean the goal is always to. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
22:45
Have data in the platform basically to start with. 
T
Tolani Thomas
22:49
Yes. Like a huge number of customers in one go. Because. The game you're about to play in terms of this like health insurance markets place thing is going to be a numbers game. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
23:03
Yeah. 
T
Tolani Thomas
23:04
So it will be worth looking at how many people actually have health insurance in Nigeria. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
23:08
What was adoption but the adoption rate. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
23:12
Is still very low. That's why I don't. I don't understand. So there's a lot to make it. But then again is not following. 
T
Tolani Thomas
23:24
I like I know that, I know I've had clients that try to take a stab at this health insurance thing in the past. And I mean like that I had a client as an insurance broker that fully licensed everything. We help them work on their licensing process and all of that and they try to take a step on this health insurance thing. People don't care until the problem actually happens. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
23:46
Yep, yep, yep, yep yep. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
23:49
That's why I figured they were trying. 
T
Tolani Thomas
23:50
To target like people that were making quote unquote daily money that didn't mind paying. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
23:59
Completely the business sector, market people, all this other stuff. 
T
Tolani Thomas
24:04
Yeah. Sorry, what'd you say? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
24:06
That whole sector is uninsured like the. 
T
Tolani Thomas
24:08
Yeah. You. It will be incredibly difficult except you do like for example. Maybe like money but then most probably say why would I do that with you? Maybe like money point that they already. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
24:25
They already have like network of agents. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
24:27
And that kind of. 
T
Tolani Thomas
24:28
Yes. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
24:28
And that crossed my mind. 
T
Tolani Thomas
24:30
Okay. We want to just onboard your agents. You have to have a very strong case to be able to do that. So you want, we want to onboard your agent. And they'll pay for like the minimum health insurance. I know like providers have like really like low risk, like 1000 Naira a month type of rates at least. Last time I checked, those kind of options were available for like the low end of the market. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
24:59
Yeah. 
T
Tolani Thomas
24:59
Like I think the lead way they could create. They had this kind of product. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
25:04
Exactly. 
T
Tolani Thomas
25:04
Nobody was really pushing it because it's a volume game. So for like. You know, the agents, maybe they can, you know, get access to your doctor for minimal things like without 1000 per month. They can get access to a doctor for minimal things like malaria and typhoid. And it's nothing beyond this. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
25:25
That makes sense. 
T
Tolani Thomas
25:26
Yeah. Like those are the major things they get you for. And if you, if it's gonna be more, then you probably have to scale up to like a 5,000 per month or per year. I think payer works like subscription model. Doesn't really work in Nigeria. To make one payment a year. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
25:46
Sorry, nobody's forced about monthly bills in Nigeria. It doesn't really work. 
T
Tolani Thomas
25:51
It doesn't really work. They don't. It has to be like if you're going to take money from Nigerians as a tech startup, it has to be like commission when they make money or it's one payment a year and they have to do it because like it has to be like do or die. They have to see the use of it. Yeah. I think in terms of you like raising. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
26:22
Out of 10, you need to. 
T
Tolani Thomas
26:23
First obviously conquer that your traction. Like you need to go over there. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
26:31
Yeah, let's assume that sorted. So out of 10, what do you give this, the whole idea of being able to find finance for something like this. 
T
Tolani Thomas
26:39
I mean, yeah, it's doable. But if, I think that if you push it as a B2B approach as opposed to, you know, individuals coming on board like, you know, you're going to be doing, if you have, if you are, if you're good to market strategy, is that okay? We're going to be partnering with organizations that have like large numbers to onboard like a large tranche of customers. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
27:03
Yeah. 
T
Tolani Thomas
27:04
Then it will be very attractive because this is a numbers game. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
27:08
That's fine. That's fine. That's done. It was part of the plan, but it wasn't forefront. But now like now you said it. That makes actual sense. That is even Easier to do the marketing for that. 
T
Tolani Thomas
27:19
Yeah. You should look at, you should. You should completely avoid being B2C. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
27:24
Why, why do you say that by any chance? 
T
Tolani Thomas
27:27
Of course, this is where startups go to die. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
27:29
Like high customer acquisition cost. 
T
Tolani Thomas
27:32
Yeah, your customer acquisition costs. Like your stuff will be on Instagram dancing. Will not sign up. They'll say, wow. So you need to. I think you need to. Once you've conquered that. Okay, this is our go to market strategy. We're doing a B2B partnerships. B2B and partnerships approach. Right. So partnerships is, you know. Okay, I'm cool with the founder of this startup that has this number of like, just like I'm using an example, I'm sure you can extrapolate from that. And they have like a large number of users and we want to partner with them to provide this service. Do you understand? And they'll say we want to push it. And if you can push the benefits, a lot of people will do it. And you know, if you can sell it as okay, you don't have to pay for your malaria drugs. 
T
Tolani Thomas
28:19
You pay 10,000 a year. We cover all your doctor visit, we cover. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
28:25
That's the angle. Then also on the insurance side, you drive numbers to them, make a bit of commission. 
T
Tolani Thomas
28:30
Yes. So you partner directly with. With the providers. With the. Insurance providers. Make sure like I'd rather you don't deal with a broker. Always give a better deal to be fair. You know, fairness brokers give you a better. Because insurance companies want to take the highest that they can take. Brokers, they know how to negotiate. Very murky industry. Sorry. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
28:54
They already know the deals are involved. 
T
Tolani Thomas
28:56
Exactly. They know how to work with each other in that regard. And then you just charge a commission on anybody like that signs up. But then at the same time, your business model can just be based on commissions. Right. From. I mean you can sell it as an like health insuretech marketplace. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
29:21
Yeah. Not just that. There's a lot of other monetization schemes because see, the idea is to capture the user. Right. There's a lifetime value for each user the platform captures. Because it's not just insurance you're selling to them. There's a whole lot of things you could upsell them this premium services. You could upsell them to like maybe predictive health, you know, health tracking. Just. There's a lot you could upsell. 
T
Tolani Thomas
29:45
Yeah. Provide us you can upsell. But I think where the magic will happen is how you get those people on your platform. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
29:54
I was thinking insurance would have been. 
T
Tolani Thomas
29:55
That easy one of the hardest things in Nigeria. If you see an insurance salesperson just hug them and put hundred dollars in. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
30:03
Their hands because you're not lying. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
30:04
They always have crooked shoes. 
T
Tolani Thomas
30:08
Is one of the most difficult things to sell. Hey, good. Like I don't, I, I don't envy them at all. It's not a fun. It'S not a fun place to be. But yeah, like it's not impossible. So they do a lot of like, they leverage a lot of like partnerships and things like that. So like do you want to get into insurance sales? I, I think that once the GCM is like locked in, you have a couple of partnerships and you use those partnerships to onboard a large tranche of users to your platform. You have a very different dynamic. And then you can take that to investors and say okay look we are non fintech. It's not sexy but it's a big market gap for this and this is the approach we are using. You know, we're partnering with. I don't know. 
T
Tolani Thomas
31:03
I'm trying to think of maybe like bumper or something like okay, I'm providing health insurance for like all the entrepreneurs. I don't know how many entrepreneurs are. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
31:09
On bumper or maybe I know how. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
31:12
To get the numbers I need. 
T
Tolani Thomas
31:14
Yeah. So like I think if you look at it, I mean I'm sure there are other insuretech. I know Cassava does a lot of this that's they are like full on insuretech. But if you're like health insuretech. Yeah, that could be like a nice niche if people see the need for your service. Right? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
31:33
Yeah. 
T
Tolani Thomas
31:36
I mean in terms of people that will potentially, how do I put it, Pay for health insurance. Reliance, all those guys, they've pretty much cornered the market. Yeah, you can, I mean you would have to be really crafty in coming up with how you are unique and then get that traction. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
31:57
I think, I don't think I'm competing. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
32:00
With reliance on the likes of them now. 
T
Tolani Thomas
32:02
You are competing with anybody that can take your customer. You're competing with people that are selling Jollof rice in Nigeria because like anybody that can take money from your customer vessels your service. You like is a battle. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
32:19
Okay. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
32:21
Okay. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
32:23
What do you reckon like the next probably next step of like line of actions would be? So I need to update the, say for instance I'm going down the insurance route. I need to update it to be more like a partnership good to market strategies against it. 
T
Tolani Thomas
32:35
No, you need to execute like you, you need to validate get users. It makes Sense like the insurance marketplace thing. It really makes a lot of sense but you need to validate it. Like you need to show that yes it is viable. Like okay, HR people need to come to your platform and say we have 1,000 staff, let's use your platform. Right? Let's use medi power and try and figure out okay, one. Insurance broke insurance health insurance provider might not work for all our staff. Manual for all our team maybe like we have like older drivers that are losing their area. They need a different type of insurance. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
33:19
That's another idea. Bulk compare like you just explained like bulk or just like I was trying to get like a go compare side of kind of thing for. But what I mean is like you're explaining say an HR is trying to compare insurance for like bulk number of people. So there's no system change to compare such a thing. So they have multiple diff. Different kind of needs they need to cover. Right. So there should be a system where they should be able to say okay, we have this kind of needs, that kind of needs for those obviously just developing our B2B2B business strategy. 
T
Tolani Thomas
33:57
Yeah. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
34:02
That makes sense. Right? That makes sense. That makes sense. Because are we doing the whole platform from scratch basically on. On a whole different. 
T
Tolani Thomas
34:11
Don't focus too much on redoing the platform. The focus should be your first 1,000 paying customers. Not even 1,000, your first. Just your first signups. 1,000 signups. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
34:23
That's very easy to do now I'm just not bothered about, you know, you. 
T
Tolani Thomas
34:28
Have to actually do it. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
34:29
Easy to say no, I don't think it's. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
34:31
Don't worry, don't worry. Just give me a couple of months, I'll get that done. Okay, that's fine. That's fine. So what you mean is say if destruction on this platform there's possibility to raise finance for this kind of thing, right? Is it? 
T
Tolani Thomas
34:43
Yes, there's opportunity definitely I'm trying to look for. I think that also going the accelerator route will do you a lot of good because I don't think you really need a lot more. I mean I don't know how much are you looking to raise. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
34:59
A couple millions to be fair. But no, that's simply because of the whole genomic component really to be fair to be able to validate this idea. 
T
Tolani Thomas
35:11
Doesn'T really grants for that because the models don't. They don't. They don't really jail because genome is the R D like it's research and development. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
35:19
So what you're saying Is right. So you're going to find finance for just the platform on its own. Let's leave that genomic thing as just a grant driven kind of finance, honestly separate from the whole thing. Okay. 
T
Tolani Thomas
35:30
I don't think it doesn't jail because it's a, it just obfuscates like it just confuses things right there. There's opportunities for you to, you know, push like a marketplace solution, you know, things like that and raise funding for that. Okay, there's opportunity for that. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
35:52
Okay. 
T
Tolani Thomas
35:52
But for the genome side of things, they're going to be like, huh? And also. I think it should be a separate company because the value of the data that you're going to get from the genome side of things cannot be quantified as the same as health insurance. They're completely different because the value of that, the value you can extract from genome data is so vast. Do you understand? Like you can, you can. If you have some data, let's say you, okay, you have genome of like 1 million. Africans, for example. Like you can then now say, okay, based on the genome, we realize that. Oh the. I'm just, I'm just assuming now I want sci fi. 
T
Tolani Thomas
36:45
So based on this genome data now that we have for 1 million Africans, we realize that all the cancer drugs that they'd be selling to Africans doesn't actually apply to them. We'll be interested that. Pfizer, AstraZeneca, just everybody that manifest would be interested in access to that data. So you know how much you can not sell the data to them. You can just give them license, quote unquote to have access to the data for like 10 years. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
37:14
I'll tell you what. Polani. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
37:16
Right, yeah. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
37:20
I hear you right. But this is the, this is where I'm having a bit of a disconnect, right? Because this platform was independent on its own, like you just explained, right? It was meant to be a PHR system and an operators os, right? Then obviously trying to monetize whatever things that come out of it, insurance, booking and premium service and all that, right? Then this whole government partnership thing came about where they felt it was a good idea to use this platform as a customer facing on ramp for that program right now when that was how this, those two merged in the first place, right? So the. Question or the problem now rather is what if the program fits data? What is there no way for the same user for those data to be interoperable for the same user? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
38:19
Because explaining it from the way, explaining it right and you're understanding it from the perspective of this genomic data can derive value independently of the insurance data. What if we're looking at it from the perspective of this user's data, right. Is because the platform is like a PHR system. So his. Their health record is meant to be longitudinal over a period of time. Right. It's not just about insurance data they generate. They could also interact with other health services. Then the genomics data also lives in their health timeline. So that timeline of data, including the insurance data, is the data the platform generates over a period of time. If that makes any sense. 
T
Tolani Thomas
39:00
It makes perfect sense. You need to rephrase like. You know why I think your business, the way I'm looking at it now, what you've written down, you're like in episode three, but your mind is like in season five. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
39:18
Come on. 
T
Tolani Thomas
39:19
I think that, I think that is what it is. You understand what I'm saying? Because what you are saying is emergency two, like if. Okay, now you're thinking of data and analytics and infrastructure and health services. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
39:32
Yes. 
T
Tolani Thomas
39:33
Right. Emergency two. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
39:35
Yeah. 
T
Tolani Thomas
39:37
So like I don't know how you want to go about it because it's. It sounds great now as we're having a conversation, but it's all about the execution at the end of it. I don't need to tell you that you're not the first time founder. So it's all about the execution, right? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
39:56
Yeah. 
T
Tolani Thomas
39:57
So it's for, for me. I mean we can have this conversation. Say yes, there's opportunity in this space. But how are you going to execute that? No, because I can tell you for free that I have like let me share my. No, I am sharing my screen. I have like, you can see what I highlighted here. I have an investor that specifically asked for this. Yeah, I can refer you to. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
40:20
No, no. I can show you the MOU we have with nabda. So you understand the scope of the program, right? I understand why we are trying to integrate it this way. It's actually a health infrastructure project. Right. This is just a customer facing on ramp for the health infrastructure project. 
T
Tolani Thomas
40:37
Understood. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
40:38
You understand? 
T
Tolani Thomas
40:39
Yes, yes, I think I understand you returner. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
40:45
So that's the general idea. 
T
Tolani Thomas
40:47
So what would it look like when you have traction? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
40:50
Well, it looks like when we have traction is we're onboarding users. They are interacting within the ecosystem. Obviously we are finding grant money to finance the genomics aspect of it while we are driving the commercial. Because that's what I'm trying to Denounce the print in my head. Right. Because I'll tell you, even in the agreements we have with the government, right, There are two separate companies. There's my company that has this platform and there's another company that signed on the agreement with the government. But those two companies are interwoven in the sense. Yeah, it's my store because that's where I want it. Because I don't want this platform mixing up in governments entanglement really. I want to be able to do my thing commercially whether or not government succeeds. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
41:34
So the way I'm looking at you. 
T
Tolani Thomas
41:37
Already, you're already embedded. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
41:38
Yeah, I know. So anyway I'm looking at it is. To position this platform as a commercially viable platform standalone on its own. Right. Then that genomic aspect adds a lot of value to the longitudinal data the platform is intended to generate about a period of time. Right. Then see what traction we can get on that side while we are still up. Because on the other side of things I think this, like you just explained this, a lot of grant finance, pandemic fund and all those sort of. There's a different funding document you have for that. But what I was trying to fish around for was what sort of commercial traction this could get. You mostly blocked out. The idea of VC finance was in my funding map. But I think VC finance is of that list. 
T
Tolani Thomas
42:28
I think that you need to. I, I still insist on what I'm saying. I understand what you're saying in terms of the bridge and you know this platform being like the on ramp to get like the general data that you need. But I think the actual ownership of the data needs to be owned by separate entity, not many power. So this is need to, this can come on board. Yes, but they need to understand that the ownership. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
42:54
There's a legal, There's a legal conundrum we are trying to solve right now. Right. So we have an MoU, we are personalizing an MoA currently. So we are then trying to decide whether we should go into a full blown spv. With NABDA being like a federal, you know, the federal agency to anchor that federal side of things while the private entities comes in makes it very easy for people like VCs to invest because there's the IP, the I, there's clarity in where everything lies. Currently it's just a bunch of moas and you know, concession documents and that's what we end up producing. But for it to be attractive to vcs it has to be more of like an SPV vehicle since this government entities involved in the partnership. 
T
Tolani Thomas
43:43
But you understand what I'm saying about separating the entities. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
43:45
Yes, that makes sense. 
T
Tolani Thomas
43:48
I think that needs to be done because you can't like VC shouldn't have like because of their investment have access to the ip. So I think the work that needs to be done is you need to validate this platform by getting some traction. I think I can make a couple of intros. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
44:04
Okay. 
T
Tolani Thomas
44:06
To vcs. I, I already like highlighted someone in particular that is interested in health care infrastructure specifically asked for that because there's not a lot of people building this space. In all honesty, there's not enough. Everybody builds the same solutions. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
44:25
I feel it's irritating how Nigerians. 
T
Tolani Thomas
44:28
It's just how they feel like, okay, you work for this guy then therefore it goes to. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
44:33
It drives me crazy that there are so many problems in that country and everybody's building fintech. 
T
Tolani Thomas
44:39
Yeah. Is what. What is how? I say they build what they can raise for. And they build what investors want to see. Because investors think this. I mean there's still opportunity in fintech. They still a lot that they can do, but they're just building what they can raise for because that's what investors will back and. Looking at investors as, you know, gods. But what do you know at the. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
45:08
End of the day? Just under human being with just extra numbers. 
T
Tolani Thomas
45:12
Exactly. What do they know? So what investors will look at is that. Oh, okay. Based on African industry. Okay. Those are the unicorns. Okay. I'll be. Those are the people that, you know, I've raised and exited safely. So they feel safer with fintech. That's, that's why everybody's focused on fintech. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
45:30
Okay, that's fine. Thank you very much for your time and your insight. I really appreciate that. But if it's possible to. You have a note of this meeting. Right. Can I get access to it at. 
T
Tolani Thomas
45:39
Some point. A second, I don't know. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
45:43
Or something like that. If that's possible. 
T
Tolani Thomas
45:49
We're using. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
45:50
Okay. 
T
Tolani Thomas
45:53
We can resolve after this call. What I, what else I wanted to say is. Okay. I lost my train of thoughts. We're talking about, you know, raising vc. Yeah. So long as you can separate that entity. Like the IP entity. Like a separate entity should own the ip. Then they can invest in medical. You can, you can definitely go VC. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
46:15
Okay. 
T
Tolani Thomas
46:17
If it's $1,000 that you make, don't. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
46:20
Worry, that's sorted out. 
T
Tolani Thomas
46:22
Then traction we can do some intros. And raise a bit of money. And then for the genome side of things, also raise Grants. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
46:34
That's fine. That's wonderful. Just explain to me fully when you mean separate the IP so I'm clear as to what I'm discussing with my lawyers. 
T
Tolani Thomas
46:46
So the. The. Just the intellectual property should be owned by say. Okay, let me explain it this way. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
46:55
Give me an example so I'll see what I'm talking. 
T
Tolani Thomas
46:57
I'll give an example. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
46:58
All right. 
T
Tolani Thomas
46:58
So I have a friend and a client that owns a company called Texture Science. So what extra science is that? They develop lab made hair, AKA synthetic hair. Like, no human hair, but hair that is made in the lab. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
47:13
Okay. 
T
Tolani Thomas
47:14
That's all. So they now have on that Texture Science, they now have regirl. Regirl is their brand, okay. That sells the lab media. But Texture Science is a different entity on his own. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
47:28
Okay. 
T
Tolani Thomas
47:28
Like, it's like the. The owner of the ip. Okay. So what we really say. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
47:33
Let me interrupt you here. So this Medi Pal is not registered in any company or anything. Right. So the owner of the IP of Medical is a company called Foreign Technology, then created Medical. Is that. Is that what you're trying to explain? Right? 
T
Tolani Thomas
47:46
Yes. Okay, that's what Fork is the owner of the ip. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
47:50
Yes. 
T
Tolani Thomas
47:51
And they are investing in Medical. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
47:53
Yes, that's. 
T
Tolani Thomas
47:54
That's all right. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
47:56
Cool. But. All right, that's fine then. So many part. Just needs to be a trademark product of foreign, isn't it? 
T
Tolani Thomas
48:05
Medipa would be a subsidiary. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
48:08
Subsidiary of foreign or foreign. Okay, that's what I need to start. 
T
Tolani Thomas
48:13
Is the owner of the data. So if you are going to be raising grants, I'll be raising the grants. Okay. Medical can raise vc. Because Medical has like a business model that can raise vc. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
48:24
This is. Okay, that's fine. Thank you so much for that. I'll. I'll get us out then circle back. 
T
Tolani Thomas
48:30
Yeah. I mean, as soon as you have a bit of traction, I think we can, you know, work together. Yeah. And I believe you are aware of our investor readiness service. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
48:42
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
T
Tolani Thomas
48:45
Okay. Ideally, after this call, Timmy will send you details on that. If that's something that you want to explore with us, we're happy to take you on. She'll send you. Terms of, you know, how we work. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
48:56
Yeah. 
T
Tolani Thomas
48:57
In terms of engagements. And if that's, you know, something you're happy to do, then you are happy to take you on. Yeah, that. That's pretty much it. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
49:08
All right, wonderful. 
T
Tolani Thomas
49:10
Do you have any questions? Like, do you have any additional questions? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
49:13
I think I'm clearing up as to what I need to do the next couple of months, then obviously circle back to you in terms of investor readiness. I think I'll circle back to you on that. When we do figure out there's type of legal scuffles you need to figure out with the government and tidy up that part of things, we can come back to what investor readiness. Because when you're saying investor readiness, say take for instance there are certain grant applications you'll be applying so NABDA will come in as a co applicant and that kind of stuff. So we need to tidy up our. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
49:42
Legalities before we come to applicants for. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
49:46
Branch research grants and that kind of stuff. 
T
Tolani Thomas
49:50
Really? Co applicant now you are working with them? Yes, but they're not equal applicants. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
49:54
Okay, interesting. 
T
Tolani Thomas
49:56
As long as you own the ip. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
49:59
Yeah. Okay, then that's fine. Okay, interesting. That solves my problem then. Okay. 
T
Tolani Thomas
50:08
Are you giving them free money? Wait, I don't understand how. So how do they get paid? Or how. How does this relationship work? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
50:17
How does this relationship work? So we are licensing this platform. National Bad technology something. Something like that. 
T
Tolani Thomas
50:30
Okay. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
50:30
I research someone some governments online. So they basically want to build a national. Basically the kind of thing 54G. Indeed. Right. But this is now a government body trying to do it and see looking for private partners to partner with to do it. So that's why we're doing it with. 
T
Tolani Thomas
50:47
Would it be legal for you to own the ip? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
50:50
Legal? No. The data they generate is. Going to be the ipa. I don't own the genomic data. The IP I own is only the platform. The data generated from the users on the platform, not the genomic data. Generic data fits to the NAVDA data bank that is going to be developed. 
T
Tolani Thomas
51:09
Okay. Okay. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
51:13
I'll just get clarity on those Legos. 
T
Tolani Thomas
51:15
Yeah. Legalities. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
51:18
Yeah. But anyways that's fine. At least I have a bit more a clearer picture as to. Okay. What the landscape looks like in terms of. Listen, then I'll get back to you when we finish. We iron out a few details. Hopefully was. Hopefully by January or so should be in Nigeria. Should I figure out a few bits of things? 
T
Tolani Thomas
51:38
You know you're not in Nigeria. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
51:41
No, not. Not at the minute. So they should finish up the. They are still trying to sort out documentation. So there's some stuff we need to. 
T
Tolani Thomas
51:52
Do next week and you have a good IP lawyer. You have a good lawyer. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
51:56
Yeah, but that's another problem. Right. The. I have a lawyer. Right. I have a couple of lawyers. But then again I'm having difficult. I'm figuring out that you know, they're not experienced in this. 
T
Tolani Thomas
52:11
So. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
52:11
So, so one now. Yes. So one is experienced in one part of it. Right. When explaining something else. He I think is not so vast in that part of that. Like in terms of this thing you explained now. Right. That's why I asked you to break it down. So it should have been my life advice to me as to how to go about that. But he's just not, you know, vast in that part of it. I don't know. I don't actually think. 
T
Tolani Thomas
52:34
Yeah. Bring real estate lawyer into. Commission and legal. So you need to find the right lawyer for that. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
52:46
Okay. 
T
Tolani Thomas
52:48
There was this girl in Nigeria. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
52:50
Right. Could you refer one. Let's see how I can work with that. 
T
Tolani Thomas
52:55
I don't know. I actually don't know an IP lawyer because honestly most of those I know like startup lawyers, those suppliers can't do. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
53:03
IP and those kind of stuff. 
T
Tolani Thomas
53:06
They have to have done it before in the past. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
53:09
So that's why I figured this guy hasn't done it in the past. 
T
Tolani Thomas
53:12
Yeah. When they haven't done it's like murky waters for them. Like they'll. They're just doing guesswork. They have to be able to. I mean I can refer a lawyer, but. He said like he's a corporate lawyer. Like he's a general like commercial lawyer. For IP law. There's someone I know that's the IP law. But he's like maybe number one in the country. I can't remember his name. One very old maladas. Because IP is very tricky. There are people that do it. I mean, I don't know. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
53:44
I think I know who to ask. All right, that was fine. I have a friend I was working on. I know because I. I figured right that most of the lawyers in most of the guys I know that practice law in Lagos. Like most of these commercial law firms. 
T
Tolani Thomas
54:02
Yes. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
54:02
Are very different from the lawyers I hang out with in Abuja. So they. 
T
Tolani Thomas
54:12
I don't understand. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
54:14
I'm telling you. So I feel like those guys in Legos will have a better idea of this thing you're talking about. 
T
Tolani Thomas
54:18
I mean the ones Lagos have. Well, I know someone that's in between actually. Like I know. I know a lawyer that is in Lagos and Abuja at the same time. There is a young guy that should be able to grasp this. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
54:29
Okay. 
T
Tolani Thomas
54:31
Yeah, please. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
54:34
That'll be lovely. 
T
Tolani Thomas
54:36
Yeah, I'm happy to make a referral. Yeah, I think can handle this. Ideally and I mean. Yeah, it should be. I mean it's up to you. At the end of the Day you can have a conversation and then decide. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
54:49
Please. That would be lovely if you can. Sorry. 
T
Tolani Thomas
54:51
Because that would be an intro email. I have your email, right? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
54:55
Yeah, yeah. This week I'll tell you, I've just been messaging the guy but if I can even share the commercial. I asked him specifically on this IP protection. I hasn't gotten back to me because I know he probably doesn't fully. You know, like you said, he's having to research and do it and that kind of stuff. I'm not sure he's done it in the past. 
T
Tolani Thomas
55:13
Yeah, it's a. And when Nigeria say ipa they're talking about music industry, so. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
55:20
Yeah. Oh really? 
T
Tolani Thomas
55:21
Yeah, they don't. I don't know how to say it's. There are people that do specifically, but those are those other lawyers that you know before you even talk. They're going to take $10,000. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
55:31
Oh, wow. 
T
Tolani Thomas
55:32
Yeah. So how I say there's not a lot of. Like people that are experts in Nigeria. Very rare. It's just the nature of the. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
55:46
Okay, no problem. We'll see how it sold out. 
T
Tolani Thomas
55:51
In terms of like investor readiness. So what would you say? What we do essentially is. I mean they will say in terms of engagement. So you can read it. What we also do is like we do the research on investors that would invest specifically in your. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
56:05
Yeah. 
T
Tolani Thomas
56:06
In your business. I was going to say projects in your business and. Yeah. And then share that. Share that list with you. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
56:12
Okay. 
T
Tolani Thomas
56:13
Yeah. And that's aside, you know, preparing deck. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
56:16
Preparing projects outside those. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
56:19
The decks and stuff like that. 
T
Tolani Thomas
56:20
Yes. So that's part of what the investor readiness comes with. Because we just felt like we introduced the investor because we felt like, okay, people were doing business plan. Like the only people that. I would say. Because one thing that we do at Highlys is that we try to measure our impact. So the only people that would say, okay, that enjoyed the business plan service or the investor business plan service, people that already had their investors. So it was a matter of them just presenting documents and then getting the funding that they needed. But then we realized that, okay, we need to take this step further and make referrals. For example, I made a referral to this investor that I shared their requirements with you that they are looking for health data analytics infrastructure and whatever. 
T
Tolani Thomas
57:08
So there was someone that we had a call like this and I just told him, I told the guy, okay, go and reach out to these people. And then he did. And then they wrote like they gave me. I think those are the R has raised from no, he raised twice. He raised 100k from those people and. I want to believe it's going well. And what else? Yeah, so we took the investor business plan like a step further developed like other documents like your product map other necessary documents that investors may ask for and then curate or do research on an idealist of 1,000 investors that would invest in your startup and also make intros where we can. Like for example I mentioned like two or three people that I mentioned to people I think we invest in you. 
T
Tolani Thomas
57:51
Those people that do non fintech but want a female co founder. Those people that do that are interested in health infrastructure analytics platform. And there's one more one of that weird visit that they're only looking for Christian founders. So I hope you're born again. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
58:06
I'm a Christian. 
T
Tolani Thomas
58:11
Those ones to add this. There are a few people that we can do. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
58:15
All right, that's lovely. That's lovely. So are this is this package. That's one deal or you have to pay for the investor mapping separately from the investor readiness. 
T
Tolani Thomas
58:25
The investor readiness is one deal. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
58:27
Okay. 
T
Tolani Thomas
58:28
Right. What is now separate is the fundraising. So if we make an intro for it you like we just an investor and they invest. We will charge a commission. But that you don't pay for that service. You don't pay for fundraising. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
58:41
Okay. 
T
Tolani Thomas
58:42
Is commission based only but investor readiness is paid. Does that make sense? 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
58:46
All right, that makes sense. That's fair enough. That's fine. What next do I need from you? All right, that's fair enough. If I can get access to this note then I'll articate what my next steps are. Now I'll circle back to you. 
T
Tolani Thomas
58:57
Once worries we get we'll send out the. I mean today is gone. We already closed but we'll send it tomorrow. And the sooner you start the better obviously. And yeah, we're looking forward to making intros. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
59:10
No worries. Thank you so very much for your. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
59:12
Time and do have Lovely. 
T
Tolani Thomas
59:14
We'll try and get you the notes as well. 
K
Kosy Ezenekwe
59:16
That would be very great if you do. Thank you so much. All right, have a great day. Bye. 
T
Tolani Thomas
59:19
You too.
